# Java Lang Ext

is a small library that contains utility functions to help the programmer
do more with less code. Like Guava, I guess, but with tuples.

* LINQ style operations
   * from(coll).map(..).group(..).join(..)
   * is lazy
* Helper methods
   * coalesce
   * str
   * isNullOrEmpty

## GWT
This library is built with GWT in mind, so everything should work with GWT versions 2.0 and later.


## HOW DO I...?
Best way to find out how to use this library is to look at the unit tests.
